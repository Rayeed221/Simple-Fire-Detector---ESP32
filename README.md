# Simple-Fire-Detector-ESP32
This is the whole code of a simple fire detector project suitable for school projects or to have something on your showcases.
This project uses C++ and with the help of ESP-32 the data we obtain from the IR (Infrared Ray) Sensors and Smoke detector sensors we can easily make conditions according to our requirements.
## Required Equipments: 
1) ESP-32
2) Usable cables
3) Smoke detector Sensor
4) Infrared ray (IR) Sensor
5) Buzzer
## Good to have Equipments:
1) BreadBoard
2) Jumper cables/wires
3) Some LED lights

## ESP-32 Pin Usages

## Using Sensor pins carefully
Use the pin numbers I used in the code or you may see some youtube tutorials on ESP-32 given below -<br/>

Take help of more tutorials of necessary. 


Use BreadBoard, it would be easier for you to manage the cables.
Please beware of correct usage of pins or else the micro-controller/hardware may get damaged.
